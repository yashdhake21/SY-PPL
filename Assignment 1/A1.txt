        1   Each  declaration is  displayed on  its own  line as  an independent
            local variable  declaration. Initializers are broken  up into simple
            declarations at the  top and an assignment statement in  the body of
            the procedure.  There is no  declaration for global  variables; they
            are used directly.

        2   A GIMPLE  statement can have  at most one operation.  Any expression
            containing  more than  one  operation is  broken  up by  introducing
            temporaries.  It  is  easy  to   convert  C  expressions  to  GIMPLE
            statements by considering abstract syntax trees, where each non-leaf
            node  must  correspond  to  either a  local  or  temporary  variable
            storage.

        3   Floats/doubles  are  displayed  in   scientific  notation,  and  any
            implicit assignments to integers are  converted to explicit casts in
            GIMPLE.

        4   Reading/writing  from/to global  variables  requires  a memory  load
            or  store operation.  As  GIMPLE  statements can  have  at most  one
            operation, the only type of  statements involving globals are of the
            form "GLOBAL  = LOCAL" or  "LOCAL =  GLOBAL". This is  because while
            local variables  of a  procedure can  reside entirely  in registers,
            every read/write  to global variables  must refer to main  memory as
            they can be accessed by  other entities (threads, I/O devices, etc).
            Hence,  any operation  on global  variables (such  as the  increment
            shown  in this  example)  has  to go  through  an  indirection of  a
            temporary version of the global  inside registers (as this temporary
            value is  not visible to  I/O devices, etc). Global  temporaries are
            named similar to the global variable but with a numeric suffix.
