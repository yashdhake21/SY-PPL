        1   If-blocks have been broken down  into distinct sections of code with
            labels  (named similar  to  temporary  variables). Control  transfer
            occurs with unconditional jumps (e.g. "goto X") or conditional jumps
            (e.g. "if Z then goto X else goto Y").

        2   The control-flow  graph dump shows  distinct basic blocks  which are
            named sequentially starting from  1. Basic blocks roughly correspond
            to  labels that  are created  during the  gimplification of  control
            statements.
