        1   Just like  scalar initialization, it  is split from  the declaration
            and  included in  the procedure  body. In  the case  of arrays,  the
            initialization is split into  multiple statements that assign values
            to  individual array  elements. This  is to  remain consistent  with
            GIMPLE's one operation per statement policy.

        2   As GIMPLE  can perform only  one operation per statement,  it cannot
            read  and write  to  array  locations at  the  same  time (as  array
            accesses  involve offset  calculation). Thus,  these are  split into
            separate read and write statements by introducing a temporary.

        3   CLOBBER statements are used for  address-escaped variables. It is an
            annotation  to  signify  that  the  scope  of  this  address-escaped
            variable has ended.
